        A <strong>website</strong> (also written as a <strong>web site</strong>)
        is one or more <span>web pages</span> and related content that is
        identified by a common <span>domain name</span> and published on at
        least one <span>web server</span>. Websites are typically dedicated to a
        particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
        entertainment, or <span>social media</span>.
        <span>Hyperlinking</span> between web pages guides the navigation of the
        site, which often starts with a <span>home page</span>. The
        <span>most-visited</span> sites are <span>Google</span>,
        <span>YouTube</span>, and <span>Facebook</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the
        <span>World Wide Web</span>. There are also private websites that can
        only be accessed on a <span>private network</span>, such as a company's
        internal website for its employees. <span>Users</span> can access
        websites on a range of devices, including <span>desktops</span>,
        <span>laptops</span>, <span>tablets</span>, and
        <span>smartphones</span>. The <span>app</span> used on these devices is
        called a <span>web browser</span>.
